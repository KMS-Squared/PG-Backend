There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  ProductGuardian

## Sub-Heading ##
  An easy-to-use barcode scanner for people with food allergies and ingredient sensitivities.

## Summary ##
  ProductGuardian makes it simple for consumers to avoid allergens and other ingredients they'd like to skip in everyday products.  This smartphone app allows shoppers to scan barcodes and get instant results if a product matches pre-selected ingredients that might be unsafe for them. ProductGuardian saves consumers from squinting at labels and saves them time.

## Problem ##
  Consumers with allergies or other sensitivities need a quick way to check if a product is safe for them or their loved ones to use.  In reading labels, it's easy to misread and miss a key ingredient in a long list. Or ingredients can be identified by multiple names.  

## Solution ##
 ProductGuardian removes the need for guesswork and reading long ingredient lists in tiny print.  Scan the barcode, and you'll get an instant notification of whether the product is safe for you. Getting started is as easy as signing in with Google, and inputting your allergies.
## Quote from You ##
  We built ProductGuardian with our own families and friends in mind, to keep them safe. 
## How to Get Started ##
  Go to our web site and download the app.  Then start scanning.
## Customer Quote ##
Before Product Guardian I either had to stick to a few foods I knew or spend hours reading labels. Now I can shop quickly and easily check out new foods.
## Closing and Call to Action ##
